            <p>- We also took the time to understand what an API is and discovered the Publicly Available APIs for Amazon and Rakuten Market, which are necessary for the Price Comparison App.</p>
            <p> - Simultaneously, we explored the data available from Ritsumeikan University, such as notification information on the Manaba platform and class schedules, among other details.</p>
            <p>- We delved into the topic of collecting bus data for the Campus Navigator app and considered the possibility of obtaining an API from Ritsumeikan.</p>
