            <h3>Tuesday, 13th June 2023</h3>
            <p>- We finished our Requirements Engineering Process.</p>
            <p>- We created the survey about Comparing System.</p>
            <button onclick="window.location.href='https://forms.gle/wnKZFBeQhWcth2Cy7'" class="btn js-week survey">Click to do our survey</button>
            <p>- We reviewed and had a discussion about the draft of the Requirements Engineering Process that I had completed, examining potential areas of improvement and determining the most effective ways to convey the information. </p>
            <p>- Simultaneously, we consulted with our TA regarding the code portion of our project.</p>
            <p>- Although our team has successfully received a response from the API, we're encountering challenges in importing the item information from the API into Swift.</p>
            <p>- Additionally, we noted that e-commerce platforms such as Amazon do not offer information on physical stores, which may necessitate the use of mock data for this aspect. We also received feedback on our user requirement survey from TA.</p>
