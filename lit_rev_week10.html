            <h4>2. Literature Review on APIs for application development (Haruto Hamano)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Web API is a kit of functions to make the software communicate with each other. Though API is provided in the same language as the programming language used by API users, since web API is an API used on an HTTP/HTTPS basis, even if the programming languages are different, it can be linked with each other and can also be used in a web browser. They enable engineers to save time and cost in developing applications by using existing code and functions from APIs (Ofoeda, J., Boateng, R., & Effah, J. 2019).</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">As there are a large number of available web APIs, however, it may be difficult for engineers to find proper them for their needs (Qi, L., He, Q., Chen, F., Zhang, X., Dou, W., & Ni, Q. 2020).  The searchers suggested the new approach which is based on a correlation graph that describes the function and compatibility information of web APIs (Qi, L., Lin, W., Zhang, X., Dou, W., Xu, X., & Chen, J. 2022). The graph is used to recommend a set of Web APIs that are both functional and compatible with a given application. By adopting this approach, they can save time and cost, and be helped to create better software. </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">According to the results of experiments, the proposed approach can recommend a set of web APIs that are both functional and compatible with a given application (Qi, L., Lin, W., Zhang, X., Dou, W., Xu, X., & Chen, J. 2022). On the other hand, the proposed approach is still in development. In the future, the accuracy and efficiency of the solution will be improved by the researchers.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Overall, APIs have the massive potential to develop applications with higher or new functions, making them more reasonable, and efficient. By using web APIs, especially, engineers can utilize additional functions from APIs whatever programming language they use. Future research in this area will enable them to employ APIs more efficiently.</div>

            <h4>3. Literature Review on Impact on Purchase Decisions (Kim YungKeon)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    "Consumer behavior" refers to the study of consumers' actions, behavior patterns, and decision-making processes. It explores how consumers select, purchase, use, and evaluate products or services. The field analyzes consumers' needs, desires, perceptions, attitudes, values, purchase motivations, influencing factors, consumption patterns, and brand preferences. Our program compare price of two website and show product information. Customer’s purchasing decision mostly depends on price (Hustic, I., & Gregurec, I. 2015) It makes customer to make decision easier.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    First, Price is one of the most important factors in people's decision to buy. Price is "money representation of the value of a thing or service." In other words, price is the value that is edified with the product. Prices will have the greatest impact on buyers' purchasing decisions. In general, online purchases are cheaper than products or services traded offline due to low material costs, human costs, and office costs. Consumers respond differentially to prices above or below the reference price (Han et al., 2001).
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Secondly, Price comparisons make it possible for people to benefit from buying things. The price of goods varies from site to site because each company may lower the price through competition, or the final sale price may vary due to the cost of the distribution process (Hustic, I., & Gregurec, I. 2015). In this paper (Hustic, I., & Gregurec, I. 2015)’s research, 86.2% of respondents are mostly look at prices when buying products. There are the same products in each website, but the prices are all different. Our program helps customers to find cheaper product. 
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Price plays a significant role in consumers' purchasing decisions. It represents the value of a product or service in monetary terms. Price has the greatest impact on buyers' decisions, and online purchases are generally cheaper due to lower material costs, labor costs, and overhead expenses. Consumers respond differently to prices above or below the reference price, indicating the importance of price in their decision-making process. Therefore, price significantly influences consumers' purchasing decisions, and price comparisons provide an opportunity for consumers to obtain better deals. By considering price as a crucial factor in selecting products or services, consumers can utilize our program to compare prices and make more informed purchasing decisions.

            <h4>4. Literature Review on Online Price Comparison Tools (Zhang Qian)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Applications for online price comparison have emerged as an essential component of the digital shopping journey, providing shoppers with a robust tool to make financially savvy purchasing choices. These applications compile data from a wide range of online retailers, offering users a comparative overview of prices for a particular product. This empowers them to opt for the most budget-friendly choice.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Research by De los Santos, Hortacsu, and Wildenbeest (2012) demonstrated that these applications significantly influence consumer behavior, enhancing price sensitivity and increasing the propensity to purchase from the lowest-priced online retailers. Their study also suggested that these applications could intensify competition among retailers, leading to overall price reductions.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Similarly, Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000) discovered that online price comparison tools could result in substantial savings for consumers. They observed that the heightened price transparency offered by these tools could decrease price dispersion, with prices gravitating towards the lowest price offered by online retailers.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    However, the efficacy of these applications can be affected by several factors. Ghose, Ipeirotis, and Li (2014) found that the precision of the price information provided by these applications could significantly impact their utility. They pointed out that inaccuracies in price data could result in subpar buying decisions, emphasizing the necessity for these applications to provide precise and up-to-date price information.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    In addition, research by Chen, Jeon, and Kim (2014) indicated that the design of these applications could significantly impact their usefulness. They found that a design that is easy to navigate could boost the chances of consumers utilizing these applications, leading to more knowledgeable purchasing decisions.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    In conclusion, online price comparison applications hold a crucial position in the e-commerce environment, influencing consumer behavior and fostering competition among retailers. However, the effectiveness of these tools hinges on the reliability of their price data and the intuitiveness of their design.

            <h4>5. Literature Review on Effectiveness of price consciousness and filtering features towards customer’s purchasing behaviors (Gabriel Evan Gunawan)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Filter features such as price comparison filter across similar products or stores, nutritional filtering filter such as health-based product filtering based on nutritional value, coupon features, promotional sale discounts, and other kinds of filters and features are believed to cause higher trust among shoppers which leads to customer retention and purchase in the future. Furthermore, features such as price filter and product funnel filter are believed to cause higher purchasing rate among customers due to their value consciousness from the price filter and buying decision.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    According to research done by Koert Van Ittersum (2022) filtering features in an online shopping platform such as nutritional value and health benefit filters, is found to reduce choice overload among customers and support customers in exercising healthier purchases. These filters alone may not effectively influence consumer behavior; however they can serve as a basis for practical tools that motivate customers to make healthier choices.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Furthermore, based on research done by YC Chen (2009) and P Bhongjan (2022) filtering features can help customers in overcoming information overload which often happens especially towards inexperienced customers who tried e-shopping for the first time. Novice shoppers often couldn’t filter a lot of information and pictures presented to them which negatively impacts their purchasing decision, so online shop retailers should consider filtering information that is presented to novice customers more carefully to not impact their purchasing decision.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    In conclusion, filtering features on an online shopping platform can lead to higher purchase rate, reducing choice overload and information overload which supporting customers into doing a better purchasing decision, and maintaining customer loyalty which maintains customer retention in a shopping platform.
