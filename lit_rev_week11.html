                    "Consumer behavior" refers to the study of consumers' actions, behavior patterns, and decision-making processes. It explores how consumers select, purchase, use, and evaluate products or services. The field analyzes consumers' needs, desires, perceptions, attitudes, values, purchase motivations, influencing factors, consumption patterns, and brand preferences. Our program compare price of two website and show product information. Customer’s purchasing decision mostly depends on price (Hustic, I., & Gregurec, I. 2015) It makes customer to make decision easier.

                    First, Price is one of the most important factors in people's decision to buy. Price is "money representation of the value of a thing or service." In other words, price is the value that is edified with the product. Prices will have the greatest impact on buyers' purchasing decisions. In general, online purchases are cheaper than products or services traded offline due to low material costs, human costs, and office costs. Consumers respond differentially to prices above or below the reference price (Han et al., 2001).

                    Secondly, Price comparisons make it possible for people to benefit from buying things. The price of goods varies from site to site because each company may lower the price through competition, or the final sale price may vary due to the cost of the distribution process (Hustic, I., & Gregurec, I. 2015). In this paper (Hustic, I., & Gregurec, I. 2015)’s research, 86.2% of respondents are mostly look at prices when buying products. There are the same products in each website, but the prices are all different. Our program helps customers to find cheaper product.

                    Price plays a significant role in consumers' purchasing decisions. It represents the value of a product or service in monetary terms. Price has the greatest impact on buyers' decisions, and online purchases are generally cheaper due to lower material costs, labor costs, and overhead expenses. Consumers respond differently to prices above or below the reference price, indicating the importance of price in their decision-making process. Therefore, price significantly influences consumers' purchasing decisions, and price comparisons provide an opportunity for consumers to obtain better deals. By considering price as a crucial factor in selecting products or services, consumers can utilize our program to compare prices and make more informed purchasing decisions.

                    In the era of e-commerce shopping, the user interface (UI) plays a crucial role in shaping shoppers' online experiences and influencing their purchasing decisions. This literature review examines the effect of UI design quality on shoppers, exploring the relationship between UI elements, user experience, and consumer behavior.

                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    According to HW Yoon (2020), Intuitive navigation systems and well-structured information architecture contribute to shoppers' ease of finding products, reducing cognitive load, and increasing their likelihood of completing a purchase. Clear and concise labeling, categorization, and search functionalities play a critical role in enhancing the browsing and decision-making process. Also, based on research done by Jung. W(2017), UI designs that incorporate personalized product recommendations based on user preferences, browsing history, and demographic information enhance shopper engagement, increase conversion rates, and drive repeat purchases.

                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Next, according to Fu. J(2022), The responsiveness of a UI, including page loading speed, smooth scrolling, and quick feedback, significantly impacts user engagement. Slow-loading pages and unresponsive UI elements will frustrate shoppers and can lead to abandonment of a shopping process.

                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Finally, according to research from D.Schubert(2016), as mobile commerce continues to grow, UI designs that can adapt to mobile devices are crucial. Mobile-friendly interfaces with responsive layouts and simplified interactions improve shopper satisfaction and support repeat purchases. Furthermore, the way products are presented through UI elements, such as high-resolution images, zoom features, and detailed descriptions, affects shoppers' perception of the product's value and influences purchase intent.

                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    In conclusion, this literature review explains the significant influence of UI design quality on shoppers and their behavior. A well-designed UI that incorporates visual appeal, intuitive navigation, usability, persuasive elements, and personalization can impact shopper engagement, satisfaction, and repeat purchase. As online shopping continues to evolve, businesses must recognize the importance of investing in UI design to create exceptional shopper experiences and gain a competitive advantage in the digital marketplace.
