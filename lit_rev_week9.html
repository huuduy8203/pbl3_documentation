            <h4>1. Literature Review on Online shoppers' response to price comparison sites (Nguyen Huu Duy)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">The response of online consumers to price comparison websites has drawn considerable attention in the study literature. Due to their ease and capacity to compare costs across various stores, these platforms have grown in popularity among customers. Explore many elements of customer behavior, use patterns, perceived benefits, restrictions, and ramifications for businesses in order to fully grasp the dynamics of online shoppers' responses.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Firstly, it's crucial to look at how online customers interact with price comparison sites in terms of consumer behavior and usage. According to research, variables including the amount of time spent on a site, the items that are compared, and the decision-making process impacted by the site may all have a big impact on how consumers behave (Jung et al., 2014). By analyzing these patterns, the project can tailor the app's features to align with online shoppers' preferences, enhancing their overall experience and satisfaction.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Secondly, understanding the perceived benefits and limitations associated with price comparison sites is crucial. Online consumers value these platforms' capacity to make educated judgments, access to a greater range of retailers, and time and money savings (Cho et al., 2014). However, there are also issues with data reliability, veracity, and possible biases. Therefore, the project should make sure to provide accurate and trustworthy information, foster user trust, and minimize any potential biases in order to solve these restrictions.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Thirdly, the impact of price comparison websites on shops is significant. Due to the increasing price rivalry brought on by these platforms, businesses must have strong differentiation and dynamic pricing strategies in order to survive and prosper (Jung et al., 2014). By incorporating features that enable retailers to monitor market trends, analyze competitors' prices, and adjust their pricing strategies accordingly, the project can provide value to both consumers and retailers, fostering healthy competition.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Last but not least, the success of price comparison applications is greatly influenced by user experience and interface design. For online retailers to draw and keep customers, their websites must have a user-friendly layout, simple navigation, and a clear presentation of pricing information (Lee et al., 2016). The project may improve the entire user experience by giving priority to these elements and developing an aesthetically pleasing and simple-to-use software, hence boosting engagement and satisfaction.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">In conclusion, understanding online shoppers' response to price comparison sites is key to developing a successful price comparison app. By examining consumer behavior, perceived benefits and limitations, implications for retailers, and emphasizing user experience and interface design, the project can create a user-centric app that meets the needs of online shoppers while supporting retailers in a competitive market.</div>

            <h4>2. Literature Review on Smart city (Haruto Hamano)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Since governments and businesses are finding how to use technology to improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban areas, a smart city is becoming very familiar. It is generally understood to be a city that uses information and communication technologies (ICT) to collect and analyze data to improve the management of the infrastructure, services, and resources (Haque, A. B., Bhushan, B., & Dhiman, G. 2022).</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">There are many benefits of the smart city. Smart city technologies can help to improve the efficiency of systems in urban areas. For example, traffic management, waste disposal, and energy use. This can lead to cost savings and reduced environmental damage (Haque, A. B., Bhushan, B., & Dhiman, G. 2022) . In addition, they can be used to improve the quality of life for citizens, such as by providing real-time information about traffic and public transportation, or by making it easier to access government services (Novotný. R, Kuchta. R & Kadlec. J, 2014).</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">However, there are also some challenges in smart city. First, smart city technologies may be expensive to implement and maintain. Second, the collection and analysis of large amounts of data are concerned about privacy and security. Moreover, it is difficult for cities to implement and manage their initiative (Haque, A. B., Bhushan, B., & Dhiman, G. 2022).</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Although it has these challenges, the potential benefits of smart cities are significant. Because the world is advancing increasingly, smart city technologies will become important for improving the efficiency, sustainability, and life quality of cities.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">There are many areas, that will be important for smart cities, which are developing new and innovative smart city technologies, improving the efficiency of smart cities, addressing the challenges of data privacy and security, developing standards for smart city technologies, and promoting the adoption of smart city technologies in cities around the world (Novotný. R, Kuchta. R & Kadlec. J, 2014).</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Overall, smart cities have the massive potential to transform cities, making them more efficient, sustainable, and livable. Future research in this area will be essential to realizing the potential.</div>

            <h4>3. Literature Review on Consumer buying decision process toward product (Kim YungKeon)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Many people use online shopping to buy product that they want. There are five customer purchase decision-making process, as follows: </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Need recognition as known as Problem recognition. Consumers recognize problems or needs that can be fulfilled by a product or service. </li>
                        <li>Information search: Consumers search for information about products or services that can fulfill their needs.</li>
                        <li>Evaluation of alternatives: Consumers evaluate available options and choose the most suitable one.</li>
                        <li>Purchase decision: The consumer decides where to buy and what to buy.</li>
                        <li>Post-purchase decision: the final stage of the consumer buying decision process, where the consumer evaluates the product after purchase. This evaluation can lead to satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the product, which can influence future buying decisions. The post-purchase decision can also lead to word-of-mouth communication, where the consumer shares their experience with others, which can influence their buying decisions.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">When consumers purchase high-involvement or costly products, they tend to go through all five stages of the purchase decision-making process. On the other hand, for low-involvement or everyday use products, there is a higher probability of skipping one or more stages. </div>

            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">The evolution of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the use of APIs in development processes are key subjects in modern software engineering studies (Lamothe, Guéhéneuc, & Shang, 2021; Tozzi, 2021).</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">Munns (2018) explored the merits of constructing API-driven microservices via Amazon API Gateway in a talk. Munns explained that Amazon API Gateway empowers developers to establish, deploy, and control secure APIs on a large scale. These APIs serve as the welcoming entry point to applications hosted on AWS. They enable businesses to proficiently handle traffic, observe version control, and maintain security standards. The talk further highlighted the significant role of the API Gateway in providing a smooth, automated, and scalable solution for managing microservices in a cloud setting.</div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Adding to the technical knowledge shared by Munns, Tozzi (2021) illuminated the advantages of an API-driven development strategy. Tozzi stressed the versatility of this approach, suggesting that it promotes faster software updates and makes the inclusion of new features easier. Furthermore, API-driven development encourages a modular coding approach, which enhances code reusability and ultimately improves the overall quality of the software. As Tozzi outlines, the primary objective of API-driven development is to create APIs that are tailored to satisfy specific user needs and align with system requirements.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Conversely, Lamothe and his colleagues (2021) performed a thorough analysis of the literature on API evolution. They observed that while APIs streamline the programming process and enhance efficiency, their continual evolution may give rise to substantial challenges. Such challenges include issues with backward compatibility, version control, and the potential for steep software maintenance costs. The significance of their study cannot be overstated as it highlights the need for continuous research on how to effectively manage API evolution.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    To conclude, the literature reviewed emphasizes the integral role of APIs in modern software development practices, while also bringing attention to the complications that can arise with their progression. Nevertheless, utilizing tools such as the Amazon API Gateway and implementing principles of API-driven development can offer solutions to these challenges (Munns, 2018; Tozzi, 2021).

            <h4>5. Literature Review on examining how consumers' intentions to use mobile price comparison (MPC) tools (Gabriel Evan Gunawan)</h4>
            <p class="lit_rev_style">
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    The paper examines how consumers' intentions to use mobile price comparison (MPC) tools are influenced by the reference prices offered at the point of sale. Customers at an electronics superstore compared prices for various items with those on a mobile price comparison website as part of the study. The results imply that consumers' intention to use an MPC at the point of sale in the future is significantly influenced by their knowledge of mobile phones and their interest in the product category. While it was not discovered that Internet skills directly affected MPC usage intentions, they were found to be highly correlated with mobile phone usage proficiency. Therefore, the level of proficiency in both skills when combined may be a key indicator of usage intention.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    Participants who recognized higher prices in online shops than in physical stores expressed a greater willingness to use MPC tools in the future compared to those shown cheaper online reference prices. However, the group exposed to cheaper online prices perceived the offline store's price competence as worse and experienced a loss of trust in the shop. The study indicates that as the online price advantage grows, consumers are more likely to patronize online shops and explore other options. With the widespread availability and increasing users proficiency in communication technology, the barriers to the adoption of MPC tools are steadily decreasing.
                </div>
                <div class="lit_rev_style_word">
                    The use of MPCs has implications for offline shops, as readily available reference prices intensify price competition for them. Shoppers may view shops with unfavorable prices in specific category as expensive stores, where they extending this perception to other categories. Word-of-mouth results in loss of trust in the shop and impacts long-term customer relationships. Furthermore, the study highlights the risk of customers physically inspecting products in-store and then purchasing them at a lower price online, potentially leading to a decline in sales for physical retailers.
